/**
 * Handler interface for user-defined cloud functions.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines the contract for processing function invocations. It is used by the
 * runtime to delegate the execution of a function with deserialized input and request context.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Implementing this interface manually is no longer required in most cases.
 * If a method is annotated with {@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Function}, a corresponding
 * implementation of this interface will be generated automatically during annotation processing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Advanced users may still implement this interface directly to provide custom invocation logic
 * or to bypass the code generation step.</p>
 *
 * @param <I> the input type (e.g., deserialized JSON request body)
 * @param <O> the output type (e.g., response body)
 *
 * @see eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Function
 * @see HandlerContext
