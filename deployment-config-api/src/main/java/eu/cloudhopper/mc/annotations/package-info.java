/**
 * Provides annotations for declaring cloud functions and API metadata.
 * <p>
 * Application developers annotate plain methods to describe how their
 * functions should be deployed and integrated; the annotation processor
 * generates the provider-specific handlers and deployment artifacts.
 * <p>
 * Function and trigger annotations (applied to a method):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Function} - marks a method as a deployable function</li>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.ScheduledTrigger} - defines a time-based (cron) trigger</li>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.HttpTrigger} - adds HTTP metadata for API gateway integration</li>
 * </ul>
 * Parameter-binding annotations (applied to a method parameter):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.RequestBody} - binds the deserialized request body</li>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.PathParam} - binds a URI path template variable</li>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.QueryParam} - binds a query string parameter</li>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.HeaderParam} - binds an HTTP request header</li>
 * </ul>
 * Vendor extensions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Extension} / {@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Extensions} - attach provider-specific attributes (see {@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.ExtensionKeys})</li>
 * </ul>
