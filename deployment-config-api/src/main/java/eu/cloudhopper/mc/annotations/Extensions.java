/**
 * Container annotation for repeating {@link Extension} annotations.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is used internally by the Java compiler to support
 * multiple {@link Extension} declarations on a single element. It is not
 * intended for direct use in application code.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instead of using this annotation directly, developers should declare
 * multiple {@code @Extension} annotations using Java's {@link java.lang.annotation.Repeatable}
 * syntax. The compiler automatically wraps them in this container.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Function(
 *     name = "myFunc",
 *     extensions = {
 *         @Extension(
 *             name = ExtensionKeys.Aws.Architecture.KEY,
 *             value = ExtensionKeys.Aws.Architecture.Values.ARM64)
 *     }
 * )
 * }</pre>
