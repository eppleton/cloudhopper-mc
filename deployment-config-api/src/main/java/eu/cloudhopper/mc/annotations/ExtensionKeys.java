/**
 * Defines well-known extension keys and allowed values for use with {@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Extension}.
 *
 * <p>This utility class provides a structured and type-safe way to reference cloud provider–specific
 * extension keys, such as AWS architecture identifiers, to avoid hardcoding strings in annotations.</p>
 *
 * <p>These constants can be used in {@link eu.cloudhopper.mc.annotations.Function#extensions()} to configure
 * deployment-specific parameters, for example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Function(
 *     name = "hello",
 *     extensions = {
 *         @Extension(
 *             name = ExtensionKeys.Aws.Architecture.KEY,
 *             value = ExtensionKeys.Aws.Architecture.Values.ARM64
 *         )
 *     }
 * )
 * }</pre>
