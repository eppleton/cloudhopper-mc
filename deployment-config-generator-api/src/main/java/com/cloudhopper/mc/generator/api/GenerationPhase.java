 * <p>
 * The available phases are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>FUNCTION</b> – Generates the serverless function configuration.</li>
 *   <li><b>API</b> – Generates the API resources and integrations.</li>
 *   <li><b>SCHEDULE</b> – Generates scheduled/cron triggers.</li>
 *   <li><b>FINALIZE</b> – Runs final configuration steps.</li>
 *   <li><b>SHARED</b> – Generates shared resources during the function phase.</li>
