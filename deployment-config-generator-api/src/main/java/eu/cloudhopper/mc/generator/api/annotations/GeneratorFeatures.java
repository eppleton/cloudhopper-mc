/**
 * Declares the features supported by a code generator module.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is placed on the class that implements a generator (e.g., {@code TemplateRegistration})
 * and is used by the Cloudhopper annotation processor to understand:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Which annotations the generator supports</li>
 *   <li>Which attributes of those annotations are recognized</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This enables validation during annotation processing and allows tools to provide early feedback
 * when unsupported annotations or attributes are used.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @GeneratorFeatures(
 *     generatorId = "aws-terraform",
 *     supportedFeatures = {
 *         @GeneratorFeature(
 *             supportedAnnotation = Function.class,
 *             supportedAttributes = {
 *                 FunctionAttribute.NAME,
 *                 FunctionAttribute.TIMEOUT,
 *                 FunctionAttribute.MEMORY
 *             }
 *         ),
 *         @GeneratorFeature(
 *             supportedAnnotation = Schedule.class,
 *             supportedAttributes = {
 *                 ScheduleAttribute.CRON,
