/**
 * Describes a feature supported by a code generator implementation.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is used within {@link GeneratorFeatures} to declare
 * which annotations and specific attributes a generator understands.
 * It allows the annotation processor to:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Validate user annotations against generator capabilities</li>
 *   <li>Emit warnings or errors for unsupported attributes</li>
 *   <li>Enable conditional generation logic</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation is intended for use by generator module authors, not application developers.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @GeneratorFeatures(
 *     generatorId = "aws-terraform-java21",
 *     supportedFeatures = {
 *         @GeneratorFeature(
